## Day 1

### Growth and washing 

+ BL21 CP strain was grown at 37 °C in six 2-l baffled flasks, each with 500 ml 2 􏰁 YT medium con- taining 34 μg/ml Cm, by circular shaking at 160 rpm. 

+ Cells were harvested in the mid-log phase (OD600 􏰅 3, usually 3–4 h)

+ washed three times with the S30 buffer (A) 

+ At this stage, we used a Polytron cell homogenizer (Kinematica AG, PT-MR3100) to facilitate resuspension of the cell pellets. 

### Storage

+ flash freeze in LN2 for at least 2 min
+ stored at –80 °C for 1–3 days 

### Yield

In a typical case, about 16 g of loosely packed cells are obtained from a 3 l culture.


## Day 2

### Resuspension and disruption 

+ The frozen cells were thawed in 50 ml of the S30 buffer (A)

+ and then collected by centrifugation at 16,000􏰁g for 30 min at 4°C 

+ Cells (7g) were suspended in 8.9 ml of the S30 buffer (B) and disrupted with 22.7 g of glass beads (B. Braun Melsungen AG 854–150/7, 􏰆 􏰃 0.17–0.18 mm) by the Multi-beads Shocker Type MB301 (Yasui Kikai, http://www.yasuikikai.co.jp) with the program: 30 sec on, 30 sec off, 30 sec on, 30 sec off, 30 sec on

+ The preparation was centrifuged twice at 30,000 􏰁 g for 30 min at 4 °C, to remove the glass beads. 

### Dialysis (4 hours)

+ The resultant supernatant (4.9 mL) was incubated at 37 °C for 80 min with 0.3 volume of the preincubation buffer (see recipe). 

+ The incubated sample was dialyzed 4 times against 50 volumes of the S30buffer (B) for 45 min each at 4 °C

+ centrifuged at 4,000 􏰁 g for 10 min at 4 °C to obtain the supernatant (the S30 extract). 

### Storage 

+ dispensed into 0.2–2.0 ml aliquots, immediately and completely frozen by being immersed in liquid nitrogen for at least 2 min
 
+ store in liquid nitrogen or below –80 °C. The S30 extract remains active for at least 1 year if stored in liquid nitrogen.


## Day 3: Expression 

+ The batch reaction mixture was incubated at 37  ̊C for 1 h.

+ The internal solution was dialyzed in a dialysis tube (Spectra/Por 7 MWCo:15,000, Spectrum) against the external solution at 30 °C for 8 h with shaking.
