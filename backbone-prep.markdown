pET29 backbone prep
===================

1. Grow up a 200 mL culture of E coli harboring pET29
2. Maxiprep the resultant culture to obtain 2 x 500 uL aliquots
   of purifed plsmid at ~ 200 ng/uL

3. Perform the following digest


75 ng / uL * 75 uL => 5,625 ng
200 ng / uL * 500 uL => 100,000 ng


Reaction conditions: recommended 

5-10 units each enzyme + 1 ug DNA in 50 uL 

(enzyme volume not to exceed 10% of total reaction volume)

NdeI and XhoI for 1 hour at 37

So for 50 ug of pET29

250-500 units enzyme + 50 ug DNA in 2500 uL

AKA 

12.5-25 uL NdeI + 
12.5-25 uL XhoI + 
250 uL CutSmart + 
500 uL DNA + 
1700-1725 uL water
