Preparation of pET29 backbone for use in cloning strings
========================================================

MATERIALS

thermal cycler 
2 + tips
200 + tips

XhoI, 1uL, -20
NdeI, 1 uL, -20
DNA solution with about 1 mg DNA, 43 uL, -20
CutSmart buffer, 5 uL, -20

DNA stain (safe)
6x DNA loading dye, 10 uL, -20

METHOD

+ Mix XhoI, NdelI, CutSmart buffer, and DNA solution (total 50 uL) 
  in tube and incubate at 37 for 1 hour

+ While that's cooking, boil 

40 mL TAE buffer
400 mg agarose 

  in a small flask or beaker. Take off heat and add

4 uL DNA stain

  and pour into desired mould. (Fat combs are easiest to load.) 

+ Go do something else for 45 minutes

+ When you get back, prepare the gel by removing the comb, etc., and 
  filling the chamber with 

about 500 mL TAE buffer

+ Add 

10 uL 6x DNA loading dye 

  to digest and load the reaction, spread out over a few wells if
  necessary, into prepared gel. 

  Run at 100-150 volts (V) for about half an hour. Check it out on the
  blue light box to see if you're getting the separation you want. 

+ Cut out the band of interest with a razor and purify with Qiagen kit.

+ Check DNA concentration. You want between 50 and 100 ng/uL. 


Notes: 25 ng/uL DNA solution gives 1 mg at 43 uL
