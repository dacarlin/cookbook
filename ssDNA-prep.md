Preparation of single-stranded DNA for use in Kunkel mutagenesis
================================================================

## Materials

+ CJ236 chemically-competent cells
+ Plates with xxx mg/mL chlorampenicol and 50 mg/mL kanamycin 
+ salt PEG: 20% PEG + 2.5 M NaCl

## Day 1

1. Transform plasmid into CJ236 cells (NEB) and plate on chlor+kan

## Day 2

2. Inoculate 2 mL TB with kan only with a few colonies from plate
3. Grow until just cloudy (4-6 hours at 37)
4. Add 2 uL M13K07 helper phage and incubate 1 hour at 37
5. Expand into 50 mL TB with kan and grow overnight at 37

## Day 3 (traditional)

6. Centrifuge culture for 20 minutes at 4700 RPM
7. Transfer supernatant into sterile 50 mL Falcon with 10 mL salt PEG
8. Mix thoroughly and incubate on ice for 45 min
9. Centrifuge for 20 min at 4700 RPM
10. Toss supernatant (remove as much as possible)
11. Resuspend pellet in 2 mL PBS and transfer to fuge tube
12. Centrifuge for 5 min at 14700 RPM
13. Transfer supernatant to fuge tubes with 300 uL salt PEG
14. Vortex and wait 10 min
15. Centrifuge for 2 min at 14700 RPM
16. Pipet off supernatant, spin, and pipet off the rest
17. Resuspend the pellet in 1 mL PBS
18. Centrifuge for 5 min at 14700 RPM
19. Transfer supernatant to new tube and prep using Qiagen M13 kit (20 min)

## Day 3 (using 0.22 micron filter)

1. Centrifuge culture for 2 hour at 4700 RPM
2. Filter using a 60 mL Luer-lock syringe and 0.22 micron filter 
   into fresh Falcon tubes with 10 mL salt PEG
3. Incubate on ice for 1 hour
4. Centrifuge for 30 min at 4700 RPM
5. Toss supernatant (remove as much as possible)
6. Resuspend pellet in 0.7 mL PBS 
7. Prep using M13 kit
